# Reproduction Instructions for Mutation Testing Script

This document provides detailed instructions on how to run the mutation testing script (mutation.sh).
Refer to scripts/project-config-status.csv for the status of each subject-program. That file indicates
whether a project can be correctly built by scripts/build.xml when following the instructions below.

Before you can run the mutation script, you must setup the testing environment.
You must have JDK 8 as your default java/javac for most of the subject-programs.

(The following two steps need to be done only once.)

1. Install the Randoop and mutation programs.
   ```
   make
   ```

2. Load the source repository for the subject-program you wish to test.  You can load the source
   for all the subject programs with:
   ```
   make src
   ```
   If you would prefer to load just the source for a single subject program, see the instructions
   at the beginning of the file:
   ```
   ../subject-programs/README.build
   ```

You are now ready to run the mutation test script.

The script takes one parameter:
    - `[project name]`: The name of the project (jar file name without ".jar") for which you want to generate tests
    and perform mutation testing. These should be one of the jar files in the `grt-testing/subject-programs` subdirectory.
    For example, to run the script on the `commons-lang3-3.0` project, you would run:
    ```
    ./mutation.sh commons-lang3-3.0
    ```


The script will generate Randoop's test suites in a "build/test" subdirectory. Compiled tests and code
will be stored in a "build/bin" subdirectory. The script will generate various mutants of the source
project using Major and run these tests on those mutants. Each experiment can run a given number of
times and a given number of seconds per class. Various statistics of each iteration will be logged to
a file "results/info.txt".

**NOTE**: The latest release of Randoop does not implement functionality for Orienteering. If you wish
to work with Orienteering, you should download and build Randoop from Github and replace $RANDOOP_JAR
with the absolute path.  For Demand-driven (PR #1260), GRT Fuzzing (PR #1304), and Elephant Brain (PR #1347),
checkout the respective pull requests from the Randoop repository.
