# Reproduction Instructions for Mutation Testing Script

This document provides detailed instructions on how to run the mutation testing script. Please follow these steps:

1. **Script Parameters**: The script takes two parameters:
    - `[jarfile name]`: The name of the jar file of the project for which you want to generate tests and perform mutation testing. These should be one of the jarfiles in the `grt-testing/tests` subdirectory
    - `[Linux directory of project's Java source code]`: The Linux directory where that project's Java source code is located. This is used for mutation generation and analysis.

2. **Running the Script**: Navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:
    ```
    ./mutation.sh [jarfile name] [Linux directory of project's Java source code] [Linux directory of project's dependency files]
    ```
    Replace `[jarfile name]` and `[Linux directory of project's Java source code]` with your actual values.

3. **Output**: The script will generate Randoop's test suites in a "build/test" subdirectory. Compiled tests and code will be stored in a "build/bin" subdirectory. The script will generate various mutants of the source project using Major and run these tests on those mutants. Each experiment can run a given number of times and a given number of seconds per class. Various statistics of each iteration will be logged to a file "results/info.txt".

**NOTE**: The latest release of Randoop does not implement functionality for Orienteering. If you wish to work with Orienteering,
you should download and build Randoop from Github and replace $RANDOOP_JAR with the absolute path.
For Demand-driven (PR #1260), GRT Fuzzing (PR #1304), and Elephant Brain (PR #1347), checkout the respective pull requests from the Randoop repository.

You must have JDK 8 as your default java/javac for commons-cli to build.
