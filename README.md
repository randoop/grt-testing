# Test cases and scripts for testing Randoop

Randoop is a unit test generator for Java.
See https://github.com/randoop/randoop for details.

This repository contains test cases and scripts for testing Randoop - specifically,
for comparison with the results found in "GRT: Program-Analysis-Guided Random Testing".
A copy of that paper may be found in this directory.

For tests, see the `tests/` directory.
