The sources for these projects are several years old.  It almost all cases
Java 8 is required to build.

Maven (mvn) builds
------------------
If the project uses Maven to build, usually indicated by a pom.xml file in
the root, a useful build command is:
  mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore -Dmaven.javadoc.skip |& tee <your log file name>

The failure.ignore option allows the .jar file to be built even if there are
some test errors.  However, if there are lots of errors, there is probably
something wrong that needs to be investigated.

The resulting .jar file will be in the target subdirectory.
