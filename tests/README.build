If you wish to build any of the test jars from source, you should clone them
from github.com/randoop. The sources for these projects are several years old
and in some cases we have made modifications to get them to compile correctly.

The name of the source repository for a given test case is the test directory
name as noted below, prepended with 'grt-'. So to get the source for bcel-5.2,
for example:
  cd src
  git clone https://github.com/randoop/grt-bcel-5.2 bcel-5.2
  cd bcel-5.2

Then follow the build instructions for the particicular tests case as noted below.
It should be noted that in almost all cases Java 8 is required to build. Also,
the environment variable JAVA_HOME should be set; for example:
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

Maven (mvn) builds
------------------
If the project uses Maven to build, usually indicated by a pom.xml file in
the root, a useful build command is:
  mvn -B clean package -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore -Dmaven.javadoc.skip |& tee <your log file name>
for pmd-core use:
  mvn -B clean package -Dmaven.test.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip -DjavaccBuildNotRequired |& tee <your log file name>

The failure.ignore option allows the .jar file to be built even if there are
some test errors.  However, if there are lots of errors, there is probably
something wrong that needs to be investigated.

The resulting .jar file will be in the target subdirectory.
